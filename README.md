Welcome to my repository.

In this project, I played with the MNIST Dataset. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/ngbolin/mnist-dataset-digit-recognizer/notebook). My aim was to reach an accuracy of >90%.


Training a convolutional neural network resulted in an accuracy of approximately 98%.
